# External Resources

Useful tools for monitoring the Bitcoin network and Knots adoption.

## Node Statistics

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Coin Dance Nodes](https://coin.dance/nodes) | Live node counts by implementation (Core vs Knots) |
| [Bitnodes](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/) | Searchable node explorer with version filtering |
| [Clark Moody Dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/) | Real-time Bitcoin network metrics |
| [The Bitcoin Portal](https://thebitcoinportal.com/) | Network statistics and node data |

### Searching for Specific Versions

On Bitnodes, you can search for specific Knots versions:

```
/Satoshi:29.2.0/Knots:20251110/
```

This shows all nodes running Knots 29.2.0 (November 2025 release).

## Historical Data

## Current Adoption

As of early 2025, based on coin.dance data:

- **Bitcoin Core**: ~18,600 nodes (78%)
- **Bitcoin Knots**: ~5,100+ nodes (21%+)

Knots adoption increased significantly following the OP_RETURN controversy in mid-2025.
